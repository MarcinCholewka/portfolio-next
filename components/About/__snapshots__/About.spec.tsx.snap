      I am a front-end developer with in-depth knowledge of React.js and its core principles, as well as front-end layout styling. I have strong communication skills, characterized by excellent interpersonal effectiveness in individual and team interactions. Over the last few years, I have gained experience in designing and implementing high-quality, elegant SaaS software for web and mobile applications. My core stack is React, but I also know TypeScript. I always want to learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a full-time job as a front-end developer.

      When I'm not coding, I spend time with my family. I like riding motorcycles and I'm constantly training my riding skills. I started practicing karate with my son, which makes me feel better when doing everyday activities. I also like learning new things. I'm currently trying to expand my knowledge of Node.js.
